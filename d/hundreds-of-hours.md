## FBI/DOJ Actors Committed Hundreds of Hours of Misconduct in *U.S. v. Raniere*

Even a **subset** of the digital evidence falsification — which seven forensic experts unanimously concluded was **facilitated and concealed by government personnel** [(see Joint Forensic Report, ¶16)](https://www.usvraniere.com/d/joint-forensic-report.pdf) — required **over 120 hours**, according to digital forensics expert **Wayne Norris**, who previously managed technical projects for the U.S. Navy [(see Norris Time Estimate)](https://www.usvraniere.com/d/norris-pm-report.pdf).

This does **not** include the additional time spent executing and coordinating broader misconduct relating to this evidence [outlined here](https://www.usvraniere.com/d/verifiable-misconduct).

The cumulative misconduct by 15+ FBI and DOJ actors easily surpasses several hundred hours.
