# There is indisputable proof of government malfeasance throughout the case beyond just the digital evidence falsification.


[15+ FBI/DOJ actors](https://www.usvraniere.com/r/malfeasance-table.pdf){:target="_blank"} committed [hundreds of hours](https://www.usvraniere.com/d/hundreds-of-hours){:target="_blank"}  of misconduct altogether. Each of the below examples are indisputably proven by the government’s own records and filings:


In a key search, agents planted incriminating items of unknown origin and used them to create and photograph false scenes but did not collect them. ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#1-fabricated-evidence-scenes-presented-to-the-jury){:target="_blank"}  – vetted by two former FBI experts with a combined 43 years of service) The jury was shown these incriminating photos of these uncollected items.


In the official search log, one FBI agent signed another agent’s name for 32 of the 40 seized items (80%) — falsifying the chain of custody. ([Proof](){https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#2-falsified-search-log-entries}{:target="_blank"})


The hard drive, containing the alleged contraband, was checked out by the lead case agent months prior to trial and never returned, according to the chain of custody. ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#18-the-hard-drive-was-checked-out-and-never-returned){:target="_blank"})


A secret, unidentified, and unauthorized FBI technician — omitted from the chain of custody and concealed for over four years post-trial— forensically manipulated a key piece of unpreserved digital evidence (the camera’s memory card) at the direction of the prosecution. This was facilitated by the lead case agent. ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#3-camera-and-memory-card-were-withheld-from-cart-and-handled-by-unauthorized-fbi-agents){:target="_blank"}, see Sections 3, 4, 6)


At least three unauthorized FBI personnel accessed this same unpreserved device, while it was uniquely withheld from the forensics unit (CART) for nearly a year — unlike the 70+ other devices. These actions are severe violations of FBI policy. (Proof same as #4)


Before and after directing the unauthorized technician operation, outside CART, on this unpreserved device, the prosecution falsely told the court all devices were sent to CART for preservation months earlier. ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#5-the-prosecution-falsely-told-the-court-all-devices-were-sent-to-cart-within-days-of-seizure){:target="_blank"}) AUSA Tanya Hajjar reinforced this falsehood by eliciting testimony from an agent that this device was only handled within CART. ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#17-ausa-hajjar-elicited-false-testimony-from-sa-christopher-mills-about-the-handling-of-the-camera){:target="_blank"})


The 1) lead case agent, 2) a senior FBI forensic examiner, and 3) the CART supervisor colluded to create and conceal an unauthorized, undisclosed second copy of this same device during trial. ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#10-at-the-end-of-trial-fbi-examiner-brian-booth-created-an-unauthorized-second--copy-of-the-memory-card){:target="_blank"}) The CART supervisor was not authorized to approve this action. The second copy’s report showed 37 additional files ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#13-booths-report-of-the-second-copy-contained-37-more-photos-than-the-first-copys-report){:target="_blank"}), many of which the 7 experts concluded were falsified and planted.^1 At trial, AUSA Hajjar falsely told the court that the senior FBI forensic examiner had not created any forensic copies. ([Proof](https://www.usvraniere.com/m/indisputable#12-during-booths-cross-examination-ausa-tanya-hajjar-falsely-assured-the-court-that-booth-made-no-copies){:target="_blank"})

The government has refused to disclose the second forensic copy to the defense yet gave it to Loveall to create his post-conviction report, despite repeated formal requests for it.
