# The search photo of the hard drive *collected* is a different color and make than the hard drive *photographed* by the FBI digital forensics unit, CART. 

There is an irregularity in the search photograph of Item 2, which was logged as the Western Digital hard drive containing the alleged contraband.

The label is on the leftmost hard drive, which is the silver/gray LaCie hard drive, which was logged as Item 3716. However, in the inventory, Item 2 is listed as “Western Digital S/N [serial number] WCAS81365334”, which matches the serial number of the black hard drive photographed by the Computer Analysis Response Team (CART). See the diagram below.
