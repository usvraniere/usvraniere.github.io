# The Government Had an Ever-Shifting Number of Alleged Illicit Photos

Strangely, the government has repeatedly changed the number of alleged illicit photos they have charged:

- Before trial: **“Approximately 15 explicit images”** across two dates (A226). [See Excerpt of Government Pre-Trial Memorandum (3/29/19, Doc. 485 at Pg. 9)](https://www.usvraniere.com/docket/485-excerpt-approx-15.pdf){:target="_blank"}

- At trial: **“18 or so images of child pornography”** spanning two dates [See Excerpt of Trial Transcript (6/12/19) Pg. 4860-4861](https://www.usvraniere.com/r/20190612-transcript-18-or-so-images.pdf){:target="_blank"}

- Post-trial: **“At least nine ... were child pornography,”** now only tied to one folder and date [See Excerpt of Government Opposition to Rule 33 (7/21/23)](https://www.usvraniere.com/r/1213-excerpt-at-least-nine.pdf){:target="_blank"}
