# Indisputable Facts of Government Malfeasance in *US v. Raniere*

The following are key and indisputable facts of government malfeasance in *US v. Raniere*. 

These facts are deemed indisputable because they are plainly evident, easily verifiable by non-experts, and not subject to reasonable dispute.

Each fact is accompanied by supporting evidence, including court filings, forensic reports, and expert statements.

### 1. Fabricated Evidence Scenes Presented to the Jury

During a key search, agents **created false scenes** using items of unknown origin, arranged them, and **photographed the manipulated setups** as evidence. These fabricated images were later **presented to the jury as authentic evidence**.

This finding, as well as  other findings of fraudulent conduct in the search, have been verified by two former FBI experts with a combined 43 years of FBI service. The first is Former FBI Senior Evidence Technician Kenneth DeNardo (see Mr. DeNardo's report linked below), corroborated by retired FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Mark Daniel Bowling; [see Mr. Bowling's declaration](https://www.usvraniere.com/docket/1273-3-bowling-declaration.pdf) {:target="_blank"}

### 2. Falsified Search Log Entries

In the official **search evidence log**, where the observing agent is required to sign, **Agent McGinnis falsely signed Agent Mills' name** for **32 of 40 items**, misrepresenting the chain of custody.

📄 **Report:** Finding 3 on Page of 9 [DeNardo Report](https://www.usvraniere.com/docket/1273-1-denardo-search-report.pdf){:target="_blank"}, entitled "SA McGinnis Improperly Signed As Other Agents For 80% of the Entries in the Evidence Recovery Log, Further Undermining Its Reliability and Integrity as a Real-Time Record"

---
### 3. Camera and Memory Card Were Withheld from CART and Handled by Unauthorized FBI Agents

Unlike all other seized items, the **camera and memory card were withheld from CART** and instead **reviewed by three unauthorized FBI agents**—Agents Rees, Lever, and an unidentified FBI technician—before finally being delivered to CART **11 months after seizure**.

This violated **FBI Digital Evidence Policy 3.3.4.5**, which mandates that **only CART personnel** can handle original digital evidence to preserve its integrity.

---

### 4. Memory Card Was Irreversibly Altered in FBI Custody

During the **11-month delay**, on **September 19, 2018**, the memory card was **irreversibly altered while in FBI custody**.  

Because it had **not yet been forensically copied** by CART, there is **no verifiable record of its original contents**, raising serious concerns about the authenticity of the data later used as evidence.

### 5. The Prosecution Falsely Told the Court All Devices Were Sent to CART "Within Days" of Seizure

The **prosecution falsely assured the court** that all seized electronic devices were sent to the FBI’s CART unit **“within days”** of seizure.  

However, **chain of custody records and the prosecution's above-mentioned disclosure show this was untrue**—the camera and memory card, remained unprocessed for **nearly a year**, and were handled by unauthorized FBI personnel before ever reaching CART.

See the prosecution's false assertions in these documents:

### 6. Four Years After Trial, the Prosecution Admitted an Unknown FBI Technician Altered Key Evidence  

For **four years**, the prosecution concealed the existence of an **unidentified FBI technician** who, at the direction of **unidentified agents**, accessed and **altered the evidence**—a fact only revealed in **2023**, long after trial.

**The prosecution refuses to disclose the identity of the agents, the technician, or any records of what was done.**

### 7. Camera and Hard Drive Were “Accidentally” Discovered to Contain Child Pornography Evidence and Used to Justify New Charges Just Nine Weeks Before Trial  

Five months after the **unidentified FBI technician altered the memory card**, the **camera and hard drive—previously considered irrelevant—were suddenly “accidentally” discovered** to contain evidence of alleged child pornography. This discovery was then used to justify **new charges** against the defendant, just **nine weeks before trial**.

---

### 8. The “Accidental Discovery” Was Impossible Under Proper FBI Protocol  
An **accidental discovery was technically impossible** under standard FBI procedures. Proper protocol **requires filtering out all files** on the hard drive that fall **outside the search warrant’s authorized date range**.  

Since the files in question were **outside that range**, they **should never have been viewable in the first place**.

### 9. The Day After the “Accidental Discovery,” Agent Lever Took the Hard Drive—And It Was Never Logged Back Into Custody  

The **day after the so-called “accidental discovery,”** **Agent Lever checked out the hard drive**—months before trial.  

However, **no record exists in the chain of custody** showing that the hard drive was **ever returned**.

### 10. At the End of Trial, FBI Examiner Brian Booth Created an Unauthorized Second  Copy of the Memory Card  

In **the last 3 days of a 6-week trial**, **FBI forensic examiner Brian Booth violated FBI protocol** by **creating a second unauthorized forensic copy** of the memory card.  

FBI policy **strictly prohibits creating multiple forensic copies** of original digital evidence, as this undermines the integrity and authenticity of the evidence.

Multiple copies of the original are prohibited because it creates opportunities for alteration or tampering.

SA Lever requested this prohibited second copy and CART member and Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) Trenton Schmatz improperly approved it, despite lacking the proper authority. (see DX 961 below)

### 11. Booth Testified That Only One Forensic Copy Was Allowed—But Never Disclosed He Had Already Created and Used a Second Copy  

FBI forensic examiner **Brian Booth testified under oath** that **only one forensic copy from the original device is permitted** under FBI policy.  

However, **he never disclosed that he had already created and used a second unauthorized copy**.

### 12. During Booth’s Cross-Examination, AUSA Tanya Hajjar Falsely Assured the Court That Booth Made No Copies  

While Booth was being **cross-examined**, **AUSA Tanya Hajjar interrupted, requested a sidebar, and falsely assured the court that Booth had made no copies**.  

Hajjar falsely represented that Booth **“never said [he] was the one who imaged [created forensic copies of] the devices”**—despite Booth’s creation of the prohibited second forensic copy of the memory card.

### 13. Booth’s Report of the Second Copy Contained 37 More Photos Than the First Copy’s Report  

The **report generated from Booth’s second forensic copy** contained **37 additional photos** that **did not appear in the original forensic copy’s report**.  

📄 **Dr. Kiper’s Report, Finding 2, Pg. 005:** [Read Report](https://www.usvraniere.com/docket/1169-1-kiper-report.pdf){:target="_blank"}  

📖 **Quote from Dr. Kiper’s Report:**  
> “However, in this second report [by Booth of the second forensic copy] there were new files present in the file listing that were not on the previous report: Namely, IMG_0042, IMG_0081, IMG_0100, IMG_0172, IMG_0179, and IMG_0193, IMG_200.”

### 14. After Trial, the FBI Brought in Quantico Expert David Loveall—Who Was Given Access to the Withheld Second Copy  

After trial, the **FBI brought in Quantico expert David Loveall**, granting him **exclusive access to the second forensic copy**, which has **been withheld from the defense**.  

Loveall then **produced an undated, unsupported report** to counter defense claims of tampering. His report **relied on undisclosed work by examiner Stephen Flatley**, who **never testified**.  

Neither **Loveall nor Flatley** were **cross-examined or subject to challenge in this case**.

---

### 15. Loveall Provided No Proof for His Claim About the 37-File Discrepancy  

In his untested report, **Loveall asserted that the 37 additional files in Booth’s second forensic copy were due to “different settings” used by the examiners (Flatley and Booth, respectively).**  

However, Loveall **provided no specifics on what settings were used, nor any proof to support this claim**.

### 16. Judge Garaufis Relied on Loveall’s Untested Report—Created With Exclusive Access to the Withheld Second Copy—To Deny a Hearing or Any Relief  

Despite the **report being untested, undated, and based on exclusive access to the undisclosed second forensic copy**, **EDNY Senior Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis relied on Loveall’s report** to deny:  

- A **hearing**  
- A **new trial**  
- **Any relief**

### 17. AUSA Hajjar Elicited False Testimony from SA Christopher Mills about the Handling of the Camera 

Special Agent Christopher Mills testified that the camera, which contained the memory card, was reviewed only with CART’s involvement:

> Hajjar: What happens when you recover a piece of digital evidence like Government Exhibit 520 [the camera] and 524 [the camera card]?
>
> Mills: ... [i]f we want the evidence to be reviewed, we would submit a request to our CART team... who would review that evidence for us or assist[] us in reviewing the evidence with us.
>
> Hajjar: And is that what happened in this case with Government Exhibit 520 [the camera]?
> Mills: Yes. (T:4307).

📄 **Trial Transcript (6/10/19), Pg. 4307** [Read Transcript](https://www.usvraniere.com/trial/20190610.pdf){:target="_blank"}  

However, this testimony was patently false. The camera had been repeatedly accessed by unauthorized FBI personnel outside of CART, months before it was ever delivered there — and in fact, it was withheld from CART for nearly a year. During that period, its memory card was irreversibly altered, and its chain of custody was compromised, as discussed above.

### 18. The Hard Drive Was Checked Out and Never Returned

After SA Lever checked the hard drive out of Evidence Control on February 22, 2019 (almost 3 months before trial), there is no record of its whereabouts. (See Figure 18 below). Notably, no entry indicates it was ever returned to Evidence Control.
