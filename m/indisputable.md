### 3. Camera and Memory Card Were Withheld from CART and Handled by Unauthorized FBI Agents

Unlike all other seized items, the **camera and memory card were withheld from CART** and instead **reviewed by three unauthorized FBI agents**—Agents Rees, Lever, and an unidentified FBI technician—before finally being delivered to CART **11 months after seizure**.

This violated **FBI Digital Evidence Policy 3.3.4.5**, which mandates that **only CART personnel** can handle original digital evidence to preserve its integrity.

### 4. Memory Card Was Irreversibly Altered in FBI Custody

During the **11-month delay**, on **September 19, 2018**, the memory card was **irreversibly altered while in FBI custody**.  

Because it had **not yet been forensically copied** by CART, there is **no verifiable record of its original contents**, raising serious concerns about the authenticity of the data later used as evidence.

### 5. The Prosecution Falsely Told the Court All Devices Were Sent to CART "Within Days" of Seizure

The **prosecution falsely assured the court** that all seized electronic devices were sent to the FBI’s CART unit **“within days”** of seizure.  

However, **chain of custody records and the prosecution's above-mentioned disclosure show this was untrue**—the camera and memory card, remained unprocessed for **nearly a year**, and were handled by unauthorized FBI personnel before ever reaching CART.

See the prosecution's false assertions in these documents:

For **four years**, the prosecution concealed the existence of an **unidentified FBI technician** who, at the direction of **unidentified agents**, accessed and **altered the evidence**—a fact only revealed in **2023**, long after trial.
