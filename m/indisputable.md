### 1. Fabricated Evidence Scenes Presented to the Jury

During a key search, agents **created false scenes** using items of unknown origin, arranged them, and **photographed the manipulated setups** as evidence. These fabricated images were later **presented to the jury as authentic evidence**.

### 3. Camera and Memory Card Were Withheld from CART and Handled by Unauthorized FBI Agents

Unlike all other seized items, the **camera and memory card were withheld from CART** and instead **reviewed by three unauthorized FBI agents**—Agents Rees, Lever, and an unidentified FBI technician—before finally being delivered to CART **11 months after seizure**.

This violated **FBI Digital Evidence Policy 3.3.4.5**, which mandates that **only CART personnel** can handle original digital evidence to preserve its integrity.

### 4. Memory Card Was Irreversibly Altered in FBI Custody

During the **11-month delay**, on **September 19, 2018**, the memory card was **irreversibly altered while in FBI custody**.  

Because it had **not yet been forensically copied** by CART, there is **no verifiable record of its original contents**, raising serious concerns about the authenticity of the data later used as evidence.

### 5. The Prosecution Falsely Told the Court All Devices Were Sent to CART "Within Days" of Seizure

The **prosecution falsely assured the court** that all seized electronic devices were sent to the FBI’s CART unit **“within days”** of seizure.  

However, **chain of custody records and the prosecution's above-mentioned disclosure show this was untrue**—the camera and memory card, remained unprocessed for **nearly a year**, and were handled by unauthorized FBI personnel before ever reaching CART.

See the prosecution's false assertions in these documents:

### 6. Four Years After Trial, the Prosecution Admitted an Unknown FBI Technician Altered Key Evidence  

For **four years**, the prosecution concealed the existence of an **unidentified FBI technician** who, at the direction of **unidentified agents**, accessed and **altered the evidence**—a fact only revealed in **2023**, long after trial.

**The prosecution refuses to disclose the identity of the agents, the technician, or any records of what was done.**

### 7. Camera and Hard Drive Were “Accidentally” Discovered to Contain Child Pornography Evidence and Used to Justify New Charges Just Nine Weeks Before Trial  

Five months after the **unidentified FBI technician altered the memory card**, the **camera and hard drive—previously considered irrelevant—were suddenly “accidentally” discovered** to contain evidence of alleged child pornography. This discovery was then used to justify **new charges** against the defendant, just **nine weeks before trial**.

### 8. The “Accidental Discovery” Was Impossible Under Proper FBI Protocol  
An **accidental discovery was technically impossible** under standard FBI procedures. Proper protocol **requires filtering out all files** on the hard drive that fall **outside the search warrant’s authorized date range**.  

Since the files in question were **outside that range**, they **should never have been viewable in the first place**.

### 9. The Day After the “Accidental Discovery,” Agent Lever Took the Hard Drive—And It Was Never Logged Back Into Custody  

The **day after the so-called “accidental discovery,”** **Agent Lever checked out the hard drive**—months before trial.  

However, **no record exists in the chain of custody** showing that the hard drive was **ever returned**.

### 10. At the End of Trial, FBI Examiner Brian Booth Created an Unauthorized Second  Copy of the Memory Card  

In **the last 3 days of a 6-week triall**, **FBI forensic examiner Brian Booth violated FBI protocol** by **creating a second unauthorized forensic copy** of the memory card.  

FBI policy **strictly prohibits creating multiple forensic copies** of original digital evidence, as this undermines the integrity and authenticity of the evidence.

SA Lever requested this prohibited second copy and CART member and Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) Trenton Schmatz improperly approved it, despite lacking the proper authority. (see DX 961 below)
